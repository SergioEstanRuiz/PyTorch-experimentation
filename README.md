# Pytorch-experimentation
A series of Jupyter notebook explaining the basics of Pytorch, with some sporadic mathematical context. Right now we have, in this order:
1. *LinearRegression.ipynb* : introduction to PyTorch by building a simple polynomial regression for synthetic data. 
2. *MNISTclassifier.ipynb* : we construct a basic image classifier and introduce concepts like convolutional layers and cross-entropy loss.
